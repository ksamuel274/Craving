The Craving App
I have developed "The Craving App," a recipe application that I conceptualized and created. The primary objective of this app is to curate recipes directly from the web and provide users with a diverse array of meals from various regions and cultures. During my undergraduate studies, I passionately undertook this project as a personal endeavor. Although it was never officially released on the app store, I am pleased to inform you that the app is fully functional and operational to this day. Utilizing SwiftUI, I successfully crafted my inaugural application, a noteworthy accomplishment of which I am particularly proud. Enclosed within this correspondence, you will find the comprehensive source code and accompanying images showcasing the app's appearance. If you possess an Apple device and Xcode, I warmly welcome you to run the app at your convenience and kindly offer your valuable feedback and impressions.
